## Features
- Discover available subtitles by file hash, IMDb ID or full-text search
- Windows shell integration (download a subtitle directly by right-clicking a file)
- Command-line availability (`subtle-cli`) for advanced use (e.g., downloading multiple subtitles recursively)

## Requirements
Subtle requires at least [.NET Framework 4.5.2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=397706). If you get  an installer error (e.g., **Error 1001. InstallUtilLib.dll: Unknown error.**), make sure it is installed on your system. It is recommended to install the latest [.NET Framework version](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5a4x27ek%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) that your OS allows.
